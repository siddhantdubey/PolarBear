# PolarBear Game
Polar Bear Game for CS404: Game Development

## Mechanics

- Two players place their bets at the beginning of a round.
- 5 6-sided Dice are rolled for each player. 
- If the number on the dice is a 3 or 5 you get points, because there are polar bears around a hole.
- For a 3 you get 2 points, because there are 2 bears around one hole.
- For a 5 you get 4 points, because there are 4 bears around one hole.
- No other roll gives you points.
- Whichever player has more polar bears wins the round and gets the other player's money. 
- The players can then choose to keep gambling, or stop playing the game.

## Aesthetics

- The players should feel like they're playing together with physical dice.
- They should feel adrenaline while playing the game and realize that it all luck and no skill. 
- They should be able to sit back and enjoy the game.

## Dynamics

- The game dynamics center around the adrenaline produced by not knowing what happens next.
- One player will be more inclined to keep playing if they're on a hot streak leading to a build up of momentum.
- The opposite is also true.
